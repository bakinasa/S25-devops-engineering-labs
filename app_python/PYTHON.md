# Python Web Application

## Framework

I chose **Flask**. Flask is a lightweight and efficient micro-framework for Python web development. It's ideal for this project because of its simplicity and ease of use. Flask provides the necessary tools to build web applications quickly, and its modular design allows easy integration with other libraries and tools.

## Best practices

To ensure code quality and maintainability:

- **Linting**: I performed code validation using `pylint` to adhere to Python's coding standards.
- **Code Formatting**: I used `black` to maintain consistent code style and readability.
